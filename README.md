# GuardianKey API reference implementation for Java

GuardianKey is a solution to protect systems against authentication attacks. It uses Machine Learning to analyze the user's behavior, threat intelligence, and psychometrics (or behavioral biometrics) and provides an attack risk in real-time. You can notify your users, block or log the attempts. There are cloud and on-premise editions. Check it in https://guardiankey.io/ . 

GuardianKey has a REST API to integrate with other systems. This is documented at https://guardiankey.io/documentation/api/ .
